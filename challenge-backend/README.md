# Backend challenge
Welcome to Bankin's Java backend challenge.

You will be adding to the existing code of this project. Setting up the project requires Java 11 and IntelliJ CE (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

## Running the project
The project builds and runs in its initial state. You can start it by typing `./gradlew bootRun` in the console. In IntelliJ, you can run it by creating a new "Run configuration" for the Gradle project "challenge-backend" with the command `bootRun`. This will allow you to use breakpoints for debugging.

The command `./gradlew build` will build the project and run the unit tests.

## The challenge
The challenge consists in: 
* Integrating the `List account` endpoint from our Bridge API (https://docs.bridgeapi.io/v2018.06.15/reference#list-accounts). The calls are already partially implemented in the `BridgeClient.java` class.
* Using the payload returned by our API response, the endpoint `/mycontroller/myroute` from this project is supposed to return all the accounts of the user, as well as the sum of the user's checking and savings accounts, rounded to the upper hundred

Notes:
* Most of the code is already in place, it's mostly a matter of fixing and renaming things. Please read the aforementionned `List account` documentation carefully.
* You're more than welcome to rename classes, methods, fields and REST routes
* Since there is a tiny bit of business logic to implement, some unit tests are most welcome
* **The credentials necessary for authenticating to the Bridge API will be provided to you in the email sent to you for the exercise. `client_id` and `client_secret` are to be configured in `application.yml`. The user's credentials are hardcoded in the `BridgeService.java` class.**
